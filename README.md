# multi_threaded_server


#Tasks completed
My server provides identity creation, authentication and authorization in a multi-threaded fashion.
I designed the protocol, wrote the server and relevant client(s) for testing of my protocol to
fulfil following tasks.

#Task 1
Identity creation: A request to new identity creation should create a user with given credentials and access
level to resources. You should assume that there are total of three resources â€“ say R1, R2 and R3. Each newly
created user can either access a resource or cannot access the resource i.e., yes/no.


#Task 2
Authentication: A request for authentication should result into a response which tells whether requested
user is valid or not.


#Task 3
Authorization: Authorization request will ask the server to provide the information if a given user can access
a particular resource or not.
